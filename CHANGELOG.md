# Changelog

## 2.7.5 - staging

## Changed

- SurveyList component rework
  - profiles are no longer subscribed to default studies inside this component
  - active surveys are now saved in the redux store so it's easy to re render the component
    from your application in case the user is assigned new surveys or studies

## 2.7.4 - 2023-11-20

### Changed

- on logout, the local storage is emptied and the persistState flag is set to false, preventing the app to save
  an empty state. This fixed an incorrect behavior during the sign up process for users that previously unsubscribed
  from the platform

## 2.7.3 - 2023-10-25

### Changed

- `immediate` surveys are only opened if they are active now (check both for validUntil and validFrom (new))

## 2.0.0 - 2022-03-10

### BREAKING CHANGES

- List of supported date locales from date-fns needs to be now explicitly passed down as an attribute for AppCore. (`dateLocales?: Array<{ code: string, locale: any, format: string }>;`). For an example, see `ParticipantApp.stories.tsx`. The passed down locales, will be registered for react-datepicker in the DateInput response component, when it's first initialized.
- For page rows, `className` property is split up into `containerClassName` and `rowClassNameOverride` to be able to customize both the containers class and override the default "row" className of the div.
- Updated to `survey-engine` v1 track that causes changes of the import path for these libs. Update for survey-engine lib is necessary.
- Signup success dialog: the dialog supports now checking verification status (reloading the user) for the case the verification was successful on an other tab or device. This requires additional translations for the `signupSuccessDialog` in the `dialogs.json` translation file.
  Following attributes are new: (with example)
  - `"msgForVerifiedAccount": "If you have just verified your account, you can use the button below to reload this page."`
  - `"reloadUser": "Check verification"`
  - `"errors.verifyEmailFirst": "You need to verify your email address first by clicking the link in the registration email. If you cannot find the email, use the button to send a new email."`
- Newer version of `react-i18n` handling plurals differently than before. Instead of `_plural` suffix, use `_other`.

### Added

- Support for globally defined translations. Page item keys can incllude the namespace `global:itemKey`, so that the translation is not searched on the current page's json file, but in the `global.json`.
- New page item type `actionCard` that utilises the ActionCard component from case-web-ui.
- Added license file.
- `AppCore` now accepts a list of custom survey response compoents to extend what response items a survey can use. Define the list through the prop `customSurveyResponseComponents`.
- New API methods to work with temporary participants.
- New exported component to prevent that can be used to prevent accidental navigation: `PreventAccidentalNavigationPrompt`.
- New study api call for downloading user reports
- New study api call for uploading participant files
- Add new exported component `InternalNavigator`, to use internal react-router instance to navigate in custom components.

### Changed

- External extension components receive a method `onNavigate: (url: string) => void`, to handle internal page navigation.
- Accordion list page item accepts className attribute to add a css class to container item.
- Replaced `node-sass` with `sass` to allow using newer nodeJS versions.
- Storybook is using webpack 5 now.
- Exporting studyAPI and reudx actions so these can be used from extension components.
- Survey component is using isLoggedIn attribute on survey context.
- Email validation rule during signup has been replaced to allow characters that are supported by the standard (.e.g, 'x').
- Include the possibility to customize footer column's className.
- Dialog config includes optional info about origin, to signalize where the dialog was opened from.
- Can open manage profiles dialog if not verified yet. (Needed to finish initial survey flow.)

### Fixes

- Sub-routes can also access extensions.
- Login and signup dialogs have improved behaviour regarding if the navigate away after successful action.
- Survey mode header handles undefined profile better.

## 1.4.1 - 2022-01-20

### Added

- Can trigger dialog opening with url query param ?action=openSignupDialog

## 1.4.0 - 2021-11-19

### BREAKING CHANGES

- `@material-ui/core` is no longer a dependency of this library.
- Navbar:
  - translation files for the navbar (`locales/<languageCode>/navbar.json`) should include `toggleBtn` and `toggleBtnAriaLabel` to localise the text behind the navigation toggle on small screens.

### Added

- The app core component can receive a list of custom react components to extend the content renderer with custom components. Simply pass down an array of `{ name: <nameOfTheComponent>, component: <react functional component>}` items. In the page configuration, you can refer to the component with the `name`. The custom component is able to call the `props.renderGenericItemFunc(item)` method which allows you the nesting of generic and custom components.
- Navbar now supports dropdown menu item to implement nested navigation / menus with more content.
- Page can contain `subPages` that are renderes as direct child routes. Rows (if any) are rendered on top first.
- New item types for page content:
  - Subrouter component implemented: type `router`.
  - To wrap items with an html div: type `container`.

### Changed

- Changed implementation of the Navbar and the Drawer for small screens.
- Verification Code input form will ignore '-' charaters (does not matter for validation or matching if you use hyphens or not). This way, we can send better formatted emails, using a hyphen in the email body to make code more readable.
- Can override navbar's right side action items.
- Updated project dependencies.

## 1.3.0 - 2021-10-20

### Added

- Email address at signup will be validation with stronger rules to prevent entering invalid email address. To set language specific error message, you can use the translation object's value of `signup.errors.emailRules`.

## Added

- New environment variable `REACT_APP_DISABLE_SIGNUP`. If defined as "true", nav-link from the navbar and from the login dialog is removed. If not defined or has any other value, it won't have any effect.

### Changed

- _BREAKING_: at signup request sent to the backend, it will send the instanceID as http header. This requires a participant-api (api-gateway) with v0.13.0 or later. This header field was included for providing the instanceID for reCaptcha validation.

## [1.0.16]

- Updated project dependecies

## [1.0.14]

### Changed

- NavLink items remove `type="button"` that causes wrong styling in Safari.
